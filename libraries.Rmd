   Managing Installed Packages in Libraries

> In short, a library is just a directory containing installed packages 

- Hadley Wickham, [R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/package.html#library)

You can view your current libraries using:

```r
.libPaths()
```

For the purpose of reproducible environments, a library is the unit we
ultimately want to reproduce. R libraries are subject to a few constraints that
must be understood to reproduce them:

1. Only 1 version of each R package can be installed and accessed in a library at a time.
2. R packages have complex dependency relationships, a working library must have a consistent set of packages that work together
3. An R library is tied to a specific version of R.
4. R can search through multiple libraries, and libraries can be shared across projects and users.

Addressing these constraints is the focus of the reproducible [strategies](./reproduce.html).

 Environments with R and Python 
---

Python is not the focus of this site, but it is a critical tool for many data scientists. Unfortunately managing Python environments can be challenging:

At RStudio, we firmly believe in open source tools, and know that most data
scientists and teams use both R and Python together. We continue to make this
process easier. To learn more, visit: https://rstudio.com/python. Or if you like videos, this
[webinar](https://resources.rstudio.com/webinars/r-python-in-rstudio-1-2-with-reticulate)
demonstrates how to combine R and Python in a variety of ways.

For information on **installing Python**, especially on Linux servers, take advantage of these resources: 

- [Single shared Python installation](https://docs.rstudio.com/resources/install-python/)
- [Multiple versions of Python, or multiple Jupyter Kernels]( https://docs.rstudio.com/rsp/integration/jupyter-multiple-python-versions/)  

For current information on **managing mixed R and Python projects**, see the [`reticulate::use_*`
functions](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/versions.html) and the [`renv::use_python` options](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/python.html).

These resources describe [best
practices](https://solutions.rstudio.com/python/overview/) for **using Python in
RStudio's commercial products**.
